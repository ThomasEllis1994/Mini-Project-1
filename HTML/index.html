                    The Reason Behind the Roundtable
                </h1>

                <div class="story">
                    Back in college, I had a friend named Brad. Brad is an
                    increbile chef, so the group would ask Brad to make us food
                    at any chance we could get. He would let us help out as his
                    kitchen crew and it was always an amazing time with
                    incredible food. Before I met brad and for a time after, I
                    was a chicken tender and mac and cheese guy. Thats pretty
                    much all I cooked besides some basic spiced chicken breasts
                    with canned veggies. But those lessons were the start of me
                    exploring more foods.

                    During the great lockdown of 2020, my friends and I were
                    spread across the country and stuck inside. Brad and I
                    started the great endevour to stay sane by just hanging out
                    on facetime while cooking. Soon our best friend Shilohe
                    heard of it and wanted to join. It was his idea to begin
                    actually cooking the same thing and to turn our evening
                    hangouts into cooking classes to teach one another different
                    recipes. Soon enough our whole sohpomore year crew was in on
                    it and we had 12 people cycling through teaching recipes.
                    Not everyone cooked, but the classes were a way of bringing
                    us together from across the country.

                    I wanted a place to share all the recipes I learned during
                    that time.This website is an homage to those classes and to
                    my friends.
