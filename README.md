Back in college, I had a friend named Brad. Brad is an increbile chef, so the group would ask Brad to make us food at any chance we could get. He would let us help out as his kitchen crew and it was always an amazing time with incredible food. Before I met brad and for a time after, I was a chicken tender and mac and cheese guy. Thats pretty much all I cooked besides some basic spiced chicken breasts with canned veggies. But those lessons were the start of me exploring more foods.

During the great lockdown of 2020, my friends and I were spread across the country and stuck inside. Brad and I started the great endevour to stay sane by just hanging out on facetime while cooking. Soon our best friend Shilohe heard of it and wanted to join. It was his idea to begin actually cooking the same thing and to turn our evening hangouts into cooking classes to teach one another different recipes. Soon enough our whole sohpomore year crew was in on it and we had 12 people cycling through teaching recipes. Not everyone cooked, but the classes were a way of bringing us together from across the country.

I wanted a place to share all the recipes I learned during that time.This website is an homage to those classes and to my friends.
